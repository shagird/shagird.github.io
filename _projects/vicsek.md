The project is motivated by the experiments of heterogeneous single-cell suspensions of two different cell/tissue types, which resulted in formation of, through cell segregation, non-trivial patterns. This is directly related to how embryos develop. 

Prof Vicsek had developed a model that modelled segregation in 2D through collective migration. Our aim in this project was to extend the collective migration model to 3D and see if it could explain the experimental results. Additionally, we created an active Brownian particle model and contrasted its results with the collective migration model. This helps validate the role of collective migration in cell segregation. The model successfully reproduces the patterns in the experiment with the collective migration model. Now, we are trying to explore the entire parameter space and characterize different pattern formations.
