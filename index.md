# Hi, I'm Raghav S. 

I am a first-year PhD Student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, USA. Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. I have completed my BS-MS from IISER Pune, India.

I am actively involved in research focused on the physics of life, collaborating on two independent projects with amazing scientists: Dr. Tam√°s Vicsek and Dr. Nir Gov. Under Dr. Gov, my Master's thesis advisor, to explore novel modeling schemes for swarming behavior in Chironomus midges. Concurrently, I am working with Dr. Vicsek's guidance, I am investigating pattern formation in 3D active particles, drawing inspiration from cell segregation experiments.

My passion lies in becoming a Computational Biophysicist, specializing in the exploration of emergent phenomena in living systems.

Research Interests 
======
My research interests are in explaining emergent behaviors/structures, appearing at organismal and and sub-organismal scales, through a quantitative lens and discover the novel physics that governs these living sytems. This will encompass both the mechanistic basis of the behavior and its functional i.e. eco-evolutionary and/or physiological context. The interaction of these properties are reffered to as structure-function relationship. I want to find out if the structure i.e emergent behavior can explain the biological function and its associated evolutionary context.
