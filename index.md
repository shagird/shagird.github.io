# Hi! I'm Raghav.

I am a [first-year Biophysics PhD Student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, USA](https://lsa.umich.edu/biophysics/people/grad-students/raghav-sharma.html). Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. I have completed my Bachelor & Master of Science degrees from IISER Pune, India. 

I am actively involved in research focused on the physics of life. Previously, I have collaborated on two independent projects with amazing scientists: Dr. Tamás Vicsek and Dr. Nir Gov. With Dr. Gov, at the Weizmann Institute, to explore novel modeling schemes and the role of activity in swarming behavior in Chironomus midges. With Dr. Vicsek, at Eötvös University in Hungary, I investigated pattern formation in three-dimensional active particles, drawing insights from cell segregation experiments. 

I want to develop my career as a Computational Biophysicist, focusing on understanding how complex patterns and phenomena "[emerge](https://www.templeton.org/news/what-is-emergence)" in living systems. This research direction combines my technical expertise with my deep interest in uncovering the fundamental principles that govern living systems. 

# Research Interests 
My research interests are explaining emergent behaviors and structures, appearing at organismal and sub-organismal scales, through a quantitative lens, and discovering the novel physics governing these living systems. This will encompass both the mechanistic basis of the behavior and its functional i.e. eco-evolutionary and/or physiological context.
